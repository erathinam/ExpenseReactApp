This is an expense tracking app built using react. The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). 

Future Enhancements: 
  1) To add image recognition api to convert image text from bills.

Bugs:
  1) Date Picker resulting in same date after adding multiple expenses.
  2) The modal retains the values entered before. Must be cleared out after
     save button pressed.
